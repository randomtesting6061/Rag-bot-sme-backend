Data-ingestion methodDetailsData ingestion via data-source connectorsZenskar can pullÂ usage data from your data infrastructure using data-source-specific connectors. Zenskar connects with your data sources, such as databases, data warehouses, comma-separated-value files, and spreadsheets. Subsequently, we move or replicate (pull) the data on our data infrastructure (destination) for further processing.Data ingestion via APIsYou can pushÂ usage data to Zenskar by creating data-ingestion APIs in Zenskar and integrating these APIs in your application workflow. Further, Zenskar exposes APIs to view or manipulate other kinds of data, such as customers, contracts, and invoices.Upload Zenskar-compatible CSVZenskar allows you to upload a Zenskar-compatible CSV.Web formZenskar provides you a web form to enter raw metrics manually.
ðŸ“šNoteZenskar stores all ingested data in the form of RDBMS tables. This is true irrespective of the ingestion method: push or pull.Tables are database objects that contain all the data in a database. In tables, data is logically organized in a row-and-column format similar to a spreadsheet.Updated 17 days ago MeteringData sources: sync data to Zenskar

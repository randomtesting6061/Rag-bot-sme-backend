An invoice is a document issued by a seller to a buyer that outlines the products or services provided, along with the amount due for payment. It serves as a formal request for payment, detailing the terms of the transaction, including the quantity, price, taxes, payment terms, and the total amount payable.
Zenskar ingests data from your data infrastructure to generate accurate invoices for you.

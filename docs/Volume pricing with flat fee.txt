Volume pricing with flat fee is a pricing strategy where a flat fee is charged, and additional usage is billed based on predefined volume tiers. Unlike standard volume pricing, where only the per-unit price decreases, this model introduces different flat fees at each volume level to account for increased operational or service costs.
This model is commonly used in SaaS, cloud services, and subscription-based platforms where customers pay a base fee and receive a certain volume of usage, with additional pricing based on their total consumption.

Example: API request
A cloud service provider charges customers for API requests based on usage tiers, with a different flat fee applied at each tier.

If a customer makes 75,000 API requests in a month:


They fall into the 50,001 - 100,000 tier.


The flat fee for this tier is $250.


API request pricing is $0.06 per request.

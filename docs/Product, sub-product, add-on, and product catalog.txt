the concepts of product and product bundle in Zenskar
how to use products and product bundles in plans and contracts

What is a product?
ðŸ”–DefinitionIn Zenskar, a product is any service or product you sell to your customer as part of a contract.
In a metered product, you measure customer activity or consumption of resources.
In a non-metered product, you do not measure customer activity or consumption of resources. You charge the customer based on the number of units purchased.


What is a product bundle?
ðŸ”–DefinitionA product bundle is a collection of related products that can be used together in a plan.
Product catalog
Product catalog is a place where an organization can define the list of products/services that they offer to their customers. These products then can be directly used in a contract or plan.
A product catalog can be accessed in two ways:

Navigate to Contracts > Products to land on the Products page.



Click on the + ADD PRODUCT button while creating or editing a contract or plan.

Putting it all together using an example
Let us assume:

you are a cloud service provider who provides compute resources in different regions of US
your services are priced differently in every region

In plain English, the product can be defined as shown below:
MarkdownCompute (product) with Minimum Gurantee - 100 USD
    Compute East Zone (sub-product)
		- Per-unit pricing - 0.01 USD/min (metered)
    Compute West Zone (sub-product)
		- Per-unit pricing - 0.02 USD/min (metered)
    Compute North Zone (sub-product)	
		- Per-unit pricing - 0.05 USD/min (metered)
    Block storage
		- Per-unit pricing - 0.01 USD/GB (metered)
Your customer is allowed to use a compute resource in any of the regions. The combined minimum charges for all the sub-products will be 100 USD, irrespective of the usage.
Add a product
The same product when defined in Zenskar will look like the following:

Here, Compute is the parent product that contains three sub-products:

Compute East Zone
Compute West Zone
Compute North Zone

You can notice that the parent product does not have a pricing model or an aggregate attached to it.
The Minimum Commitment feature is assigned to the parent product, Compute. The baseline charge irrespective of usage is set to 100 USD.
Add sub-products
Compute East Zone

The compute resources are provided in the east zone at 0.01 USD/min.
The usage is metered. You must select an appropriate aggregate from the Usage Aggregate drop-down.


Compute West Zone

The compute resources are provided in the west zone at 0.02 USD/min.
The usage is metered. You must select an appropriate aggregate from the Usage Aggregate drop-down.


Compute North Zone

The compute resources are provided in the north zone at 0.05 USD/min.
The usage is metered. You must select an appropriate aggregate from the Usage Aggregate drop-down.


Add add-ons
The compute resource already comes with enough storage to install an operating system. However, if needed, the customer can add more block storage. Block storage is never sold individually and must be purchased in the context of a compute product. Therefore, block storage is an add-on.
To keep the example simple, let us assume that the block storage is charged at 0.01 USD/GB (metered) in all the zones.

A new network-related add-on
Imagine a scenario where you are forced to charge for network usage in the east zone:

from 0â€“1 TB/month, 1 USD/month
from 2 TB/month onward, 1.5 USD/month

The new contract for east zone can be described in English as follows:
MarkdownCompute (product) with Minimum Gurantee - 100 USD
    Compute East Zone (sub-product)
		- Per-unit pricing - 0.01 USD/min (metered)
    Compute West Zone (sub-product)
		- Per-unit pricing - 0.02 USD/min (metered)
    Compute North Zone (sub-product)	
		- Per-unit pricing - 0.05 USD/min (metered)
    Block storage
		- Per-unit pricing - 0.01 USD/GB (metered)
    Network
    - Tiered pricing
    	- from 0â€“1 TB/month, 1 USD/month (metered)
      - from 2 TB/month onward, 1.5 USD/month (metered)
You can edit a product and add a new add-on for network related usage and charges.

The Compute East Zone sub-product will now have a Block Storage and a Network add-on:

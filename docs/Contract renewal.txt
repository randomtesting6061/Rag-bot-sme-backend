Contract renewal policies
You can choose one of the following renewal policies:

Don't renew automatically: the contract will not be renewed.
Renew with same contract terms: the contract gets renewed while preserving all customization applied to the original template.
Renew without customer-specific prices: the contract gets reset to default template values before renewal.

ðŸš§NoteA contract is created using a template. Optional customization may be applied to the template while defining the contract.

ðŸš§NoteAn organization-level contract renewal policy will be applicable to all contracts.
How it works
All contracts that expired in the past 25 hours are examined. For all expired contracts, the following steps are are taken:

If a contract renewal policy was applied during the creation of the contract, the said policy will be applied.
If the contract doesn't have a renewal policy, the organization-level contract renewal policy is applied.
If no organisation-level renewal policy exists, the contract is not renewed.

Entitlements refer to services or products that your customers are entitled to. Entitlements are generally used to store customer balances. Customer balances can be created in various ways. Some are listed below:

Quantity-based entitlement (measured in units):

You sell 10 units of a service or product to a customer for $100. In this case, the customer is entitled to 10 units of said service or product.
You sell a subscription for $100 per month, and each month you offer the customer 50 free units to consume as a part of the subscription. If these free units are not consumed during the month, they are carried forward until the contract is active. In this case, the free units are tracked across billing cycles using entitlements.


Credit-based entitlement (measured in currency): you sell $1000 worth of credits to a customer for $900. In this case, your customer is entitled to spend $1000 on your platform.

ðŸš§Entitlements vs free unitsFree units that expire at the end of product billing period need not be tracked across billing periods. Therefore, an entitlement is optional for such free units. For all other expiry conditions, an entitlement must be attached to the free units node.

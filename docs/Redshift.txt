Overview
The Redshift source supports Full Refresh syncs. Zenskar will copy all rows in the tables and columns you set up for replication.
This Redshift source connector is built on top of the source-jdbc code base and is configured to rely on JDBC 4.2 standard drivers provided by Amazon via Mulesoft here as described in Redshift documentation here.
Sync overview
Resulting schema
The Redshift source does not alter the schema present in your warehouse. Depending on the destination connected to this source, however, the schema may be altered. See the destination's documentation for more details.

Incremental Sync
The Redshift source connector supports incremental syncs. To setup an incremental sync for a table in Redshift, you must setup a user-defined cursor field such as an updated_at column. The connector relies on this column to know which records were updated since the last sync it ran.
Defining a cursor field allows you to run incremental-append syncs. To run incremental-dedupe syncs, you'll need to tell the connector which column(s) to use as a primary key. See the incremental-dedupe sync docs for more information.

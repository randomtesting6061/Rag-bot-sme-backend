Tiered pricing with flat fee is a pricing strategy where customers are charged a flat fee, and additional usage is billed based on the specific tier they fall into. Unlike volume-based pricing, which applies the same unit price once a certain threshold is reached, tiered pricing assigns distinct costs to each tier based on usage levels.
This approach is commonly employed in SaaS, cloud services, and subscription-based platforms, where pricing is structured in tiers to incentivize higher usage while ensuring a fair and scalable cost distribution across customers.

Example: Cloud storage
A cloud storage provider charges customers for storage based on usage tiers, with a different flat fee applied at each tier.

If a customer stores 750 GB data in a month, the total bill they have to pay is USD 448:

Volume pricing with flat fee versus tiered pricing with flat fee
ModelHow It WorksExampleVolume Pricing with Flat FeeA single flat fee is applied based on the highest usage tier, and all units are billed at that tier’s per-unit rate.If 750 GB is stored, only the 501-1000 GB tier’s pricing applies ($100 + $0.01 per GB).Tiered Pricing with Flat FeeEach tier has its own flat fee, and pricing is calculated separately for usage within each tier.If 750 GB is stored, fees are charged at all three tiers separately, leading to a total of $170.Updated 5 days ago Tiered pricingTwo-dimensional tiered pricingTable of Contents

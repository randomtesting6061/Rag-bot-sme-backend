How is step pricing strategy different from volume and tiered pricing strategies
Step pricing strategy is based on a flat fee defined for each step. However, the volume and tiered pricing strategies are based on per-unit pricing for each tier. Therefore, in step pricing strategy, if a step is defined as 1-100 units of a service or product, the flat fee defined for the step will be applicable irrespective of whether the customer purchases 1 or 100 units of the service or product.

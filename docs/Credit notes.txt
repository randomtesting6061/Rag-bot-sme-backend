ðŸ”–Note
Approved, partially paid, and paid invoices cannot be edited. Therefore, credit notes must be issued to amend such invoices.
Draft invoices can be directly edited. Therefore, credit notes do not apply to draft invoices.
Refer to the documentation on the life cycle of a invoice for more details.
Some prominent reasons for issuing a credit note are listed below:

Billing errors: if the buyer was overcharged (e.g., an incorrect amount was invoiced), a credit note corrects the error.
Discounts: sometimes, sellers issue credit notes as a result of post-sale discounts or price adjustments.
Returns: if the buyer returns goods or products, the seller issues a credit note to reduce the amount owed.
Damaged goods: if goods received by the buyer are damaged or defective, the seller may issue a credit note to reflect the compensation or price reduction.

These include accounts like Revenue (broken down by product and customer), Accounts Receivables (broken down by customer), Credit Balances, Unearned Revenue, etc.
These entries can then be posted to your external ERP/accounting system using Zenskar's Accounting integrations, or via CSV export if the Integration is not available yet.
Zenskar has an extremely flexible Accounting Rule Engine that can be customised to your specific revenue recognition needs. You get sane defaults off the shelf, but can choose to customise them based on your specific use cases or local regulations very easily if required.

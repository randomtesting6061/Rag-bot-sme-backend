📖 Definitions
🔖MetricsMetrics represent all the data that you capture to analyze trends across your business and technology domains. Raw metrics are unfiltered data. Derived metrics, on the other hand, are generated when a certain combination of selection criteria (or filters) is applied on the raw metrics.Metering is the act of measuring customer activity or consumption of resources to collect the metrics needed to generate an invoice.Aggregates are derived metrics. Average, count, distinct, maximum, minimum, and sum are some selection criteria (or filters) applied on raw metrics to derive aggregates.
🔖ContractA Contract, in general, is a formal and legally binding agreement between you and your customers. This is an all-encompassing document that defines how you and your customers will conduct business. In Zenskar, however, the concept of a contract refers only to a subset of the general contract and contains data related to pricing models and other billing determinants.
🔖PlanA plan is a reusable contract pattern that contains product and feature definitions.
A plan can be used as a guide to make tangible Zenskar contracts.
A contract that is based on a plan will inherit all the products and features of the plan it is based on. You can override the plan values to create customized contracts.

🔖ProductIn Zenskar, a product is any service or product you sell to your customer as part of the contract.
In a metered product, you measure customer activity or consumption of resources.
In a non-metered product, you do not measure customer activity or consumption of resources. You charge the customer based on the number of units purchased.

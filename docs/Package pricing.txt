Package pricing works based two parameters: package size and package price.
Let us assume that a product is sold as a package under the following conditions:
Package size (units)Package price (USD/package)1010

If the customer purchases 10 units, they will be billed for 10 units or 1 package or 10 USD.
If the customer purchases 11 units, they will be billed for 20 units or 2 packages or 20 USD.

Add a product based on package pricing
ðŸ”–ImportantRefer the products documentation to learn more about the concept of products in Zenskar.
Step 1: Add a product based on package pricing

Navigate to Contracts > Products, and click on the ADD PRODUCT button.
Select the Package Pricing from the drop-down.
Select or deselect Metered:

If the service or product is metered, select the appropriate usage aggregate from the drop-down.
If the service or product is not metered, enter the quantity.


Fill in all other details, and select all the desired features.
Save the product.

Example: non-metered purchase
Details:
ðŸ”–A short storyLet us assume that six malaria-injection vials are recommended as full course of medication. Also, let us assume that this full course of medication comes in a tamper proof package. Therefore, if someone needs a seventh vial (maybe, they broke a vial), a full package must be shipped.

Malaria-injection vials are being sold as a package:

Package size (units)Package price (USD/package)6600

This is a one-time purchase (non-metered product).


Example: metered purchase

Continuing with the above story, let us assume that the customer requires continuous supply of malaria-injection vials.
Maybe, they are in a tropical country with high rates of malaria infection.
This situation can be handled by turning the one-time purchase in to a recurring purchase (metered product).
Since it is recurring, the number of purchases must be tracked. This process of tracking purchases is called metering.

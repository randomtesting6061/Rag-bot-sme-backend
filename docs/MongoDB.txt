This guide will help you set up MongoDB as a data source for your Zenskar account.
Prerequisites
Create users
Run mongo shell, switch to admin database and create a READ_ONLY_USER. READ_ONLY_USER will be used for Zenskar integration.
mongouse admin;db.createUser({user: "READ_ONLY_USER", pwd: "READ_ONLY_PASSWORD", roles: [{role: "read", db: "TARGET_DATABASE"}]})
üößAccessPlease ensure that the user has appropriate access levels: read-only privileges. A user with higher or lower privileges may result in errors.
Enable MongoDB authentication
Open /etc/mongod.conf and add/replace specific keys:
net:  
	bindIp: 0.0.0.0

security:  
	authorization: enabled

Setting bindIP to 0.0.0.0 will allow connections to database from any IP address.
The last line will enable MongoDB security: only authenticated users will be able to access the database.

Configure firewall
Make sure that MongoDB is accessible from external servers. Specific commands will depend on the firewall you are using (UFW/iptables/AWS/etc). Please refer to appropriate documentation.
Your READ_ONLY_USER should now be ready for use with Zenskar.
TLS/SSL on a Connection
It is recommended to use encrypted connection. Connection with TLS/SSL security protocol for MongoDb Atlas Cluster and Replica Set instances is enabled by default. To enable TSL/SSL connection with Standalone MongoDb instance, please refer to MongoDb Documentation.

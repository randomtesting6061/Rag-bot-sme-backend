Each Zenskar account must be mapped with an account on Xero, as shown in Fig. 3. The dropdown shows all the non-system accounts present on Xero i.e., accounts for which journal entry creation is possible. You can select an appropriate account:

How Zenskar journal entries look on Xero
Xero does not allow you to create entries with line amount equal to zero. Therefore, entries created with line amount zero such as Free units are not synced with Xero.
The actual Accounts Receivable and other system accounts cannot be used to create Journals. This is a known limitation of Xero. Therefore, you should map the Zenskar Accounts Receivable with something similar in Xero. For example, you can use the Create Account checkbox to create a new account with similar name in Xero.
Example 1: When credits are issued to a Customer

System account names for these entries are:

Customer Wallet: 4a003f19-ae13-4fe2-b7bb-98666a8abcd
Expenses: Sales Returns and Allowances: 4a003f19-ae13-4fe2-b7bb-98666a8abcd

Example 2: When an invoice is approved

System account names for these entries are:

Revenue: Storage - Volume Pricing: 4d24700c-29de-4351-aa5a-965e3334abcd
Revenue: SQS - Per Unit Pricing: 4d24700c-29de-4351-aa5a-965e3334abcd
Assets: Accounts Receivable: 4d24700c-29de-4351-aa5a-965e3334abcd

Example 3: When a payment is made

System account names for these entries were:
Assets: Cash: 4d24700c-29de-4351-aa5a-965e3334abcd
Assets: Accounts Receivable: 4d24700c-29de-4351-aa5a-965e3334abcd
Usually the last element in the system account name is customer Id. Therefore it is ignored. All the accounts visible in the entries are created according to the mapping. The customer visible in the description is also created on Xero if it is not already present.Updated 17 days ago SAPZoho BooksTable of Contents

This guide will help you set up Metabase as a data source for Zenskar.
üößPrerequisitesTo connect Metabase with Zenskar, you need:
username and password: credentials to authenticate with Metabase instance. This may be used to generate a new session_token, if necessary. An email from Metabase may be sent to the owner's account everytime this is being used to open a new session.
session_token: credential token to authenticate requests sent via Metabase API. A session token expires after 14 days by default.
instance_api_url: the URL to interact with Metabase instance API, that uses https.

‚öôÔ∏è Acquire a session token
You can find or create session tokens from Metabase by running the following command:
Shellcurl -X POST \
-H "Content-Type: application/json" \
-d '{"username": "[email¬†protected]", "password": "sample_password"}' \
http://localhost:3000/api/session
If you‚Äôre working with a remote server, you‚Äôll need to replace localhost:3000 with your server address. This request will return a JSON object with a key called id and the token as value in the form of a UUID or GUID:
{"id":"38f4939c-ad7f-4cbe-ae54-78906daf1234"}
You can use the received token as your session_token when configuring the connector.
üößExpiration of tokensCredential tokens expire after 14 days by default. You need to update your connector configuration with a new token when that happens.
If you are hosting your own Metabase instance, you can configure this session duration on your metabase server by setting the environment variable MAX_SESSION_AGE (in minutes).
‚ùóÔ∏èInvalid or expired session token errorsThe connector will alert you of an invalid or expired session token by returning a 401 Unauthorized response status code.

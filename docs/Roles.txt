People often get confused between authentication and authorization. It is important to remember that authorization is not the same as authentication:
AuthenticationAuthorizationAre you who you claim to be?Are you allowed to do what you are trying to do?You are challenged to validate your credentials through mechanisms such as password verification, fingerprint matching, facial recognition.You are provided access to a resource through policies and rules created by an administrator.Generally governed by the OpenID Connect (OIDC) protocol.Generally governed by the OAuth 2.0 framework.
In summary, access to a resource is protected by both authentication and authorization: you have to prove your identity and possess appropriate permissions to interact with resources

Important concepts are summarized in the table below:
Authorization objectDescriptionPermissionsSets of permitted verbs (or actions) on a set of resources. In Zenskar, Read, Write, Delete, and Approve are the verbs available.RolesCollections of permissions. You can bind (or assign) users to a role.BindingsAssociations of a user with a role.

Case 1: If the product is metered, it is priced at a percentage of the selected billable metric, measured in the currency configured in the contract. Refer to this section for details.
Case 2: If the product is not metered, it is priced at a percentage of the quantity, measured in the currency configured in the contract. Refer to this section for details.

Case 1: A metered percentage-based product


Let us take Delivery charges as an example of a metered percentage-based product.


Let us assume that a billable metric named Compute is attached to the product. Compute returns the number of units shipped in a given billing cycle.


Let us calculate delivery charges as a percentage of the value returned by Compute.
In general, for metered percentage-based product, the following equation hold true:
Amount contributed by the percentage-based product to the invoice = (Percent * Billable metric) / 100

Therefore,
Delivery charges (USD) = (Percent * Compute) / 100



Let us assume that Compute reports 100 units being shipped in the given billing period.


Product namePercent (USD)Billable metric (units)Delivery charges5100

The delivery charges for the above example can be calculated as shown below:
Delivery charges (USD) = (5 * 100) / 100 = USD 5

Case 2: A non-metered percentage-based product


Let us continue with Delivery charges as an example of a percentage-based product. However, in this example, Delivery charges is a non-metered product.


Delivery charges being a non-metered product, the quantity is predefined in the product.


Let us calculate delivery charges as a percentage of the predefined quantity configured in the product.
In general, for non-metered percentage-based product, the following equation hold true:
Amount contributed by the percentage-based product to the invoice = (Percent * Quantity) / 100

Therefore,
Delivery charges (USD) = (Percent * Quantity) / 100


Let us assume that a quantity of 100 units were shipped in a given billing period, per product definition.


Product namePercent (USD)Quantity (units)Delivery charges5100

The delivery charges for the above example can be calculated as shown below:
Delivery charges (USD) = (5 * 100) / 100 = USD 5

The invoice for the above examples is shown below. The percentage-based product, Delivery charges, is highlighted:

📖Tax versus AvaTaxAvalara AvaTax automates the complete process of sales tax calculations and filing. However, the Tax option in the Add More Features section of a plan or product provides you an alternative for sales tax calculations: enter a tax percentage based on the jurisdiction and product category for calculations. You will have to handle the filing process yourself.

Enter the applicable AvaTax System Tax Code in the Tax Code field.
Click Save.

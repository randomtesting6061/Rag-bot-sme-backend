Flat-fee pricing is a model where a flat or fixed price is agreed upon in advance for delivering a specific product or service. The total cost, scope, and timeline are determined upfront, providing both parties with clear expectations and no surprises. This approach offers transparency and simplicity, making it easier for customers to understand the overall cost from the start.

Anatomy of an Avalara tax code
Most Avalara tax codes are made up of eight characters: two letters to start and six numbers at the end.

The first letter indicates the tax code type (P for products, D for digital, Fr for freight, S for services, O for other).
The second letter indicates the tax code category (for example, C for clothing).
The six numbers indicate subcategories under the tax code category.

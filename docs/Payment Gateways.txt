Zenskar right now accepts payments via Stripe but we are working on adding support for other payment gateways. After obtaining a payment gateway and a merchant account (if required), the next step is to configure it in Zenskar. To configure your payment gateway, log in to the web interface and go to Settings > Connectors  and click on the payment gateway you want to integrate.Updated 17 days ago Default Payment MethodAccounting
